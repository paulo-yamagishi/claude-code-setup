# Markdown Style Rules

- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown extensions
- Headers: `#` for title, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections
- Code blocks with language tags (```json, ```bash, etc.)
- Tables for structured comparisons
- Keep files under 300 lines where possible
- Cross-reference other files with relative paths: `../core/hooks-guide.md`
- Use concrete examples and code blocks, not vague descriptions
