# Code Style Rules

## Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (project standard)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multi-line structures
- Prefer single quotes for strings (unless language convention differs)

## Naming
- Variables and functions: camelCase (JS/TS) or snake_case (Python)
- Classes and types: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Files: kebab-case for modules, PascalCase for components

## Patterns
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Use guard clauses
- Keep functions under 50 lines
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except loop indices)
